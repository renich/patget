Download all sponsee's attachments @ Patreon
--------------------------------------------

Description
===========
Get all visible attachments from your Patreon sponsees.


Instructions
============
Attach the minified version of the script (Bookmarklet) into your Firefox/Google Chrome bookmark bar and click on it while visiting
one of your sponsee's month views.

It works everywhere at the time of publishing, but it works better on the 'by month' view.

Minification
------------
You could, also, read the script, change it, and minify it. It will, also, convert it into a bookmarklet. I've provided a make file
so you can just type: `make` and you're done!

Otherwise, you can just run `utils/minify.bash` and you will get the exact same result.


Notes
=====
The minification I use is partial minification; not the unreadable kind ;).


Known issues
============
* Sometimes, Google Chrome gets stuck when multi-downloading stuff (on Gentoo).


Disclaimer
==========
I did this while I was bored; on vacation. I despise JavaScript and I wouldn't trust myself in these matters. Still, it works fine
for me and wanted to share it.
